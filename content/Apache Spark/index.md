This section of the blog will focus on using **Apache Spark**. I'll be using **Scala** as the programming language, but all the concepts are the same in Python, making it easy to convert Scala code to Python since the two APIs are very similar.

II've created a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/simdangelo/apache-spark-blog-tutorial) containing the code for each chapter of this series, so that you can replicate the examples on your computer. Before diving into any articles, make sure to follow the [01. Run Spark Applications](Apache%20Spark/01.%20Run%20Spark%20Applications.md) to set the right environment on your locale machine to run Spark Applications in Scala using **IntelliJ IDE**.
