`dict` type is a fundamental part of Python's implementation. Many constructs in Python are represented by dictionaries in memory. Due to their importance, Python **dictionaries** are **highly optimized** and **Hash Tables** are the **engines behind Python's high performance dictionaries**.

Other built-in types based on hash tables are `set` and `frozenset` that have a richer APIs compared to sets in other programming languages.
# 1. Modern `dict` syntax
## 1.1. dict Comprehensions
A **dictcomp** (dict comprehension) builds a `dict` instance by taking `key:value` pairs from ant iterable and the syntax derives from listcomps and genexps.

Let's make a simple example:
```python
dial_codes = [
    (880, 'Bangladesh'),
    (55, 'Brazil'),
    (86, 'China'),
    (62, 'Indonesia')
]

country_dial = {country: code for (code, country) in dial_codes}
ountry_dial_2 = {code: country.upper() for country, code in sorted(country_dial.items()) if code < 70}
```
Then:
```terminal
>>> country_dial
{'Bangladesh': 880, 'Brazil': 55, 'China': 86, 'Indonesia': 62}

>>> country_dial_2
{55: 'BRAZIL', 62: 'INDONESIA'}
```

Note that we could pass the iterable `dial_codes` directly to the `dict()` constructor, but with the dict comprehension we swapped the `country` and the `code`.
## 1.2. Unpacking Mappings
PEP 448 enhanced the support of mapping unpackings in two ways:
1. we can apply `**` to more than one argument in a function call; this works if the keys are all strings and unique across all arguments (because duplicate keyword arguments are fobidden):

	```terminal
	>>> def dumps(**kwargs):
	...    return kwargs
	
	>>> dumps(**{'x': 3, 'y': 10}, z='4', **{'s': 15})
	{'x': 3, 'y': 10, 'z': '4', 's': 15}

	>>> dumps(**{'x': 3, 'y': 10}, z='4', **{'x': 15})
	TypeError: __main__.dumps() got multiple values for keyword argument 'x'
	```

2. `**` can be used inside a `dict` literal (in this case duplicates are allowed and later occurrences overwrite previous ones):

	```terminal	
	>>> {**{'x': 3, 'y': 10}, 'z': '4', **{'s': 15}}
	{'x': 15, 'y': 10, 'z': '4'}
	```
## 1.3. Merging Mappings with `|`
Python 3.9 supports `|` and `|=` to merge mappings.

The `|` operator creates a new mapping:
```terminal
>>> d1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
>>> d2 = {'x': 10, 'a': 20}

>>> d1 | d2
{'a': 20, 'b': 2, 'x': 10}
```

The `|=` operator updates an existing mapping in-place:
```terminal
>>> d1
{'a': 1, 'b': 2}

>>> d1 |= d2
>>> d1
{'a': 20, 'b': 2, 'x': 10} 
```
# 2. Pattern Matching with Mappings (TODO)
*TODO*
# 3. Standard API for Mapping Types
The `collections.abc` module provides the `Mapping` and `MutableMapping` abstract class describing the interfaces of `dict` and similar types:
![](Technical%20Books/Fluent%20Python/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241009221529.png)
```terminal
>>> from collections.abc import Mapping, MutableMapping

>>> my_dict = {}
>>> isinstance(my_dict, Mapping)
True

>>> isinstance(my_dict, MutableMapping)
True
```

Note that using `isinstance` with an abstract class is often better then checking whether a function argument is of the concrete `dict` type, because then alternative mapping types can be used (Chapter 13 *TODO TOUNDERSTAND*).

To implement a custom mapping, it's easier to extend the concrete class `collections.UserDict` from the standard library, instead of subclassing those abstract class. That's because it encaspulate the basic `dict` in its implementation, which in turn is built on hash table. The limitation is that the key must be hashable.
## 3.1. What is Hashable
This is the definition of **Hashable** adopted by the [Python Glossary](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-hashable):
> [!cite]
> An object is **hashable** if it has a hash value which never changes during its lifetime (it needs a `__hash__()` method), and can be compared to other objects (it needs an `__eq__()` method). Hashable objects which compare equal must have the same hash value.
> \[...] and their hash value is derived from their `id()`.

+ numeric type, `str`, and `bytes` are all hashable;
+ container types are hashable is they are immutabl and all contained objects are also hashable;
+ a `frozen` set is always hashable, because every element contained must be hashable by definition;
+ a `tuple` is hashable only if all its elements are hashable;
+ user-defined types are hashable by default (*WHY? TODO on the book*).
```terminal
>>> tt = (1, 2, (30, 40))
>>> hash()
-3907003130834322577


>>> tl = (1, 2, [30, 40])
>>> hash(tl)
TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'

>>> tf = (1, 2, frozenset([30, 40]))
>>> hash(tf)
5149391500123939311
```
## 3.2. Overview of Common Mapping Methods
Let's see the methods implemented by `dict` and two popular variations: `defaultdict` and `OrderedDict`, both defined in the `collections` module:
![](Technical%20Books/Fluent%20Python/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241017220829.png)![](Technical%20Books/Fluent%20Python/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241017221008.png)

The way `d.update(m)` handles the argument `m` is a proper example of **duck typing**: if first checks whether `m` has a `keys()` method and, if it does, assumes it is a mapping. Otherwise, `update()` falls back to iterating over `m`, assuming its items are `(key, value)` pairs. Let's see the most common cases:
+ `m` is a mapping type:
```terminal
>>> d1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
>>> d2 = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}
>>> d1.update(d2)
>>> d1
{'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}
```
* `m` is a list of tuples:
```terminal
>>> d = {'a': 1}
>>> list_of_tuples = [('b', 2), ('c', 3)]
>>> d.update(list_of_tuples)
>>> d
{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
```
* `m` is a tuple of tuples:
```terminal
>>> d = {'a': 1}
>>> tuple_of_tuples = (('b', 2), ('c', 3))
>>> d.update(tuple_of_tuples)
>>> d
{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
```

Note that the constructor for most Python mapping uses the same logic of `update()` internally, which means they can be initialized from other mappings or from any iterable object producing `(key, value)` pairs:
```terminal
>>> list_of_tuples = [('b', 2), ('c', 3)]
>>> dict_from_list_of_tuples = dict(list_of_tuples)
>>> dict_from_list_of_tuples
{'b': 2, 'c': 3}

>>> tuple_of_tuples = (('b', 2), ('c', 3))
>>> dict_from_tuple_of_tuples = dict(tuple_of_tuples)
>>> dict_from_tuple_of_tuples
{'b': 2, 'c': 3}
```
