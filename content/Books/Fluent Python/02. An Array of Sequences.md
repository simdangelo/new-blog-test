# Sequences Introduction
Sequences in Python (such as **strings**, **bytes**, **lists**, **tuples**, arrays, etc.) result share a rich set of common operations, including **iteration**, **slicing**, **sorting**, and **concatenation**.

The standard library offers a rich selection of sequence types implemented in C:
* **Container Sequences**: can hold items of different types, including nested containers (i.e. `list`, `tuple`, `collections.deque`); they hold references to the objects they contains in their own memory space.
* **Flat Sequences**: can hold items of one simple types (i.e. `str`, `bytes`, `arra.array`); they contain the value of its contents it their own memory space.

Another way of grouping sequencee types is by mutability:
* **Mutable Sequences**: like `list`, `bytearray`, `array.array` and `collections.deque`;
* **Immutable Sequences**: like `tuple`, `str`, and `bytes`.
A **Mutable Object** is an object that can have its value modified **in-place**.
Here's how mutable sequence inherit all methods from immutable sequences, and implement several additional methods:
![](Books/Fluent%20Python/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240613195549.png)The built-in concrete sequence types do not actually subclass the `Sequence` and `MutableSequence` abstract base classes, but they're virtual subclasses registered with those ABCs (*what does that mean? I don't understand*).
A quick way to build a sequence is using a **List Comprehensions** (aka **listcomps**) if the target is a `list`, or a **Generator Expression** (aka **genexps**) for other kind of sequences.
# List Comprehensions and Generator Expressions
`list` is the most fundamental sequence type.
Here's a `list` created with classic `for` loop:
```python
symbols = '$c£p`≠'
codes = []
for symbol in symbols:
    codes.append(ord(symbol))
```
and here's a `list` created with a **List Comprehension**:
```python
codes = [ord(symbol) for symbol in symbols]
```
The `codes` variable will be in both cases:
```
[36, 99, 163, 112, 96, 8800]
```
List Comprehensions build lists from sequences or any other iterable type by filtering and transforming items. Indeed, the `filter` and `map` built-ins can be composed to do the same, but readability suffers, as we'll see now.
With list comprehension:
```python
beyond_ascii = [ord(s) for s in symbols if ord(s) > 127]
```
and with `filter` and `map` functions:
```python
beyond_ascii = list(filter(lambda symbol: symbol > 127, map(ord, symbols)))
```

We can also use **Generator Expressions** to initialize tuple, arrays, and other types of sequences:
```python
import array
symbols = '$c£p`≠'

tuple_instance = tuple(ord(symbol) for symbol in symbols)
array_instance = array.array("I", (ord(symbol) for symbol in symbols))

print(tuple_instance)
print(array_instance)
```
Output:
```
(36, 99, 163, 112, 96, 8800)
array('I', [36, 99, 163, 112, 96, 8800])
```
Note that the first argument of the  `array` constructor defines the storage type used for the numbers in the array (`I` in our case).
# Tuples are not just Immutable Lists
**Tuples** as "immutable lists" is a simplification. Tuple can be used:
* as immutable lists
* as records with no field names (overlooked case)
## Tuple as Records with no field names
Tuple holds records: each item in the tuple holds the data for one field, and the position of the item gives its meaning. This means that the number of **items is usually fixed** and their **order is always important**. Indeed, if you think of Tuples just as immutable lists, the order of the items may or may not be important, and that's not the case.
Example:
```python
lax_coordinates = (33.9425, -118.408056)
city, year, pop, chg, area = ('Tokyo', 2003, 32_450, 0.66, 8014)
```
Note that in both expression, sorting the tuple would **destroy the information**.
## Tuple as Immutable Lists
Two benefits:
* **Clarity**: when you see a `tuple` in code, you know its length will never change;
* **Performance**: a `tuple` uses less memory than a `list` of the same length, and it allows Python to do some optimizations.
> [!attention]
> The **immutability** of a `tuple` only **applies to the references contained in it**. References in a tuple cannot be deleted or replaces. But, if one of those references points to a mutable object (like a `list`), and that object is changed, then the value of the `tuple` changes.

![](Books/Fluent%20Python/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240615151912.png)
```python
a = (10, 'alpha', [1, 2])
b = (10, 'alpha', [1, 2])

print(a)
print(b)
print(a==b)
```
Output:
```
a = (10, 'alpha', [1, 2])
b = (10, 'alpha', [1, 2])

print(a)
print(b)
print(a==b)
```
But, if you change the list content inside the tuple `b`, this statement is no longer valid:
```python
b[-1].append(99)

print(a)
print(b)
print(a==b)
```
Output:
```
(10, 'alpha', [1, 2])
(10, 'alpha', [1, 2, 99])
False
```

> [!attention]
> **Tuples** with **mutable object** items can be **source of bugs**.

As we'll see later on, an object is only **Hashable** if its value cannot ever change. An **Unhashable** tuple cannot be used as a key in a `dict` or as an element in a `set`.
If you want to determine explicitly if a tuple (or any object) has a fixed value, you can use the `hash` built-in:
```python
def fixed(o):
    try:
        hash(o)
    except TypeError:
        return False
    return True

a = (10, 'alpha', [1,2])
b = (10, 'alpha', (1,2))
c = (10, 'alpha', {'key1': "value1"})
d = (10, 'alpha', {'key2': [0,1]})
e = (10, 'alpha', 99)

print(fixed(a))
print(fixed(b))
print(fixed(c))
print(fixed(d))
print(fixed(e))
```
Output:
```
False
True
False
False
True
```
 
 Performance advantages of using Tuple as immutable lists are explained by Python Core developer at this link [link here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68630/are-tuples-more-efficient-than-lists-in-python/22140115#22140115). To summarize:
 * To evaluate a tuple literal, the Python compiler generates bytecode for a tuple constant in one operation; but, for a list literal, the generated bytecode pushes each element as a separate constant to the data stack, and then builds the list.
 * Given a tuple `t`, `tuple(t)` simply returns a reference to the same `t`, so there's no need to copy. In contrast, given a list `l`, the `list(l)` constructor must create a new copy of `l`.
	```python
	a = (10, 20, 30)
	b = tuple(a)
	
	c = [10, 20, 30]
	d = list(a)
	
	
	print(a is b)
	print(c is d)
	```
	Output:
	```
	True
	False
	```
* Because of its fixed length, a `tuple` instance is allocated the exact memory space it needs. Instance of `lists`, on the other hand, are allocated with room to spare, to amortize the cost of future appends:
	```python
	import sys

	print(sys.getsizeof(tuple(iter(range(10)))))
	print(sys.getsizeof(list(iter(range(10)))))
	```
	Output:
	```
	120
	136
	```
* The references to the items in a tuple are stored in an array in the tuple struct, wgile a list holds a pointer to an array of references stored elsewhere. This indirection is necessary because when a list grows beyond the space currently allocated, Python needs to reallocate the array of references to make room.
Note that `list` and `tuple` have different APIs.
# Unpacking Sequences and Iterables
**Unpacking** is important because it avoids unnecessary and error-prone use of indexes to extract elements from sequences. Unpacking works with any **iterable** object as the data source - including iterators, which don't support index notation.
The most visible form of unpacking is **Parallel Assignment**: assign items from an iterable to a tuple of variables:
```python
lax_coordinates = (33.9425, -118.408056)
latitude, longitude = lax_coordinates

print(latitude)
print(longitude)
```
Output:
```
33.9425
-118.408056
```
An elegant application of unpacking is **Swapping the values of Variables** without using a temporary variable:
```python
b, a = a, b
```
Another example of unpacking is **Prefixing an argument with `*` when Calling a Function**:
```python
t = (20, 8)
quotient, remainder = divmod(*t)

print("quotient: ", quotient)
print("remainder: ", remainder)
```
Output:
```
quotient: 2
remainder: 4
```
if I had run the code:
```python
t = (20, 8)
quotient, remainder = divmod(*t)
```
I would have obtained:
```
TypeError: divmod expected 2 arguments, got 1
```
## Using `*` to Grab Excess Items
Defining function parameters with `*args` to grab arbitrary excess arguments is a classic Python feature:
```python
a, b, *rest = range(5)
print(a, b, rest)

a, b, *rest = range(3)
print(a, b, rest)

a, b, *rest = range(2)
print(a, b, rest)

a, *body, c, d = range(5)
print(a, body, c, d)

*head, b, c, d = range(5)
print(head, b, c, d)
```
Output:
```
0 1 [2, 3, 4]
0 1 [2]
0 1 []
0 [1, 2] 3 4
[0, 1] 2 3 4
```
*More examples in the book*
# Slicing
A common feature of `list`, `tuple`, and `str`, and all sequence types in Python is the support of **Slicing Operations**.
## Why Slices and Ranges Exclude the Last Item
The Pythonic convention of excluding the last item in slices and ranges works well with zero-based indexing used in Python, C, and many other languages. Convenient features:
* it's easy to see the length of a slice or range when only the stop position is given. For example both `range(3)` and `my_list[:3]` produce three items;
* it's easy to compute the length of a slice or range when start and stop are given: `stop - start`. For example:
	```python
	my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
	
	sliced_list = my_list[2:5]
	print(len(sliced_list))
	```
	Since `5-2=3` we expect `3`. Output:
	```python
	3
	``` 
* it's easy to split a sequence in two parts at any index `x`, without overlapping. For example:
	```python
	my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]

	print(my_list[:3])
	print(my_list[3:])
	```
	Output:
	```python
	[10, 20, 30]
	[40, 50, 60]
	```
# `list.sort()` vs `sorted(list)` built-in
### `list.sort()`
* The `list.sort()` method **sorts a list in place** - that is, without making a copy and it doesn't create a new list.
* It returns `None` to remind us that it changes the receiver (the receiver is the target of a method call, a `list` object in this case).

> [!info] Python Convention
> Important Python API convention: **Functions or methods that changes an object in place** should return `None` to make it clear to the caller that the receiver was changes and no new object was created.
> 
> Drawback: we cannot cascade calls to those methods. Look at [Fluent Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface).
### `sorted(list)`
* The built-in function `sorted()` creates a new list and returns it.
* It accepts any iterable object as an argument, including immutable sequences and generators.

Python Sorting Algorithm is stable, meaning that it preserves the relative ordering of items that compare equally. For example:
```python
fruits = ['apple', 'grape', 'raspberry', 'banana']
fruits_sorted2 = fruits.copy()

fruits_sorted = sorted(fruits, key=len)
fruits_sorted2.sort(key=len)

print(fruits_sorted)
print(fruits_sorted2)
```
Output:
```
['apple', 'grape', 'banana', 'raspberry']
['apple', 'grape', 'banana', 'raspberry']
```
As you can see, `apple` and `grape` has the same length and the sorting algorithm preserved their order.
