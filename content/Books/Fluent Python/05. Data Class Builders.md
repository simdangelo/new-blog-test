Python offers a few ways to build a **simple class that is just a collection of fields, with little or no extra functionality**. This pattern is known as "**Data Class**".

We'll see three different class builders:
1. `collections.namedtuple`
2. `typing.NamedTuple`
3. `@dataclasses.dataclass`
# Overview of Data Class Builders
Let's consider a simple class and show its limitation and then we'll rewrite it with the three solutions mentioned above:
```python
class Coordinate:
	def __init__(self, lat, lon):
		self.lat = lat
		self.lon = lon

moscow = Coordinate(55.76, 37.62)
location = Coordinate(55.76, 37.62)


print(moscow)
print(location == moscow)
print((location.lat, location.lon) == (moscow.lat, moscow.lon))
```
Outout:
```
<__main__.Coordinate object at 0x10452bf40>
False
True
```
Problems:
* To store `lat` and `len` we had to write those words 3 times;
* Line 1: `__repr__` inherited from `object` is not very helpful;
* Line 2: meaningless `==` operator because the `__eq__` method inherited from `object` compares objects IDs;
* Line 3: comparing two coordinates requires explicit comparison of each attribute.
### 1. `collection.namedtuple` implementation
`collection.namedtuple` is a factory function that builds a **subclass of `tuple`** with the name and fields we specify:
```python
from collections import namedtuple

Coordinate = namedtuple("Coordinate", "lat lon")

moscow = Coordinate(55.76, 37.62)
location = Coordinate(55.76, 37.62)


print(issubclass(Coordinate, tuple))
print(moscow)
print(location == moscow)
```
Output:
```
True
Coordinate(lat=55.76, lon=37.62)
True
```
* Line 1: it's a `tuple` subclass;
* Line 2: useful `__repr__`;
* Line 3: meaningful `__eq__`.
### 2. `typing.NamedTuple` implementation
This function adds a type annotation to each fields and even this one builds a **subclass of `tuple`**. Basically, it's a typed version of `namedtuple`:
```python
import typing

# Alternative 1
Coordinate = typing.NamedTuple("Coordinate", [("lat", "float"), ("lon", "float")])
# Alternative 2
Coordinate = typing.NamedTuple("Coordinate", lat=float, lon=float)

moscow = Coordinate(55.76, 37.62)
location = Coordinate(55.76, 37.62)


print(issubclass(Coordinate, tuple))
print(moscow)
print(location == moscow)
```
The output is the same as the `collection.namedtuple` case.

Since Python 3.6, `typing.NamedTuple` can also be used in a `class` statement, with type annotations. This is much more readable, and makes it easy to override methods or add new one:
```python
from typing import NamedTuple

class Coordinate(NamedTuple):
	lat: float
	lon: float

	def __str__(self):
		ns = "N" if self.lat >= 0 else "S"
		we = "E" if self.lon >= 0 else "W"
		return f"{abs(self.lat):.1f}°{ns}, {abs(self.lon):.1f}°{we}"
```
>[!info]
>Although `NamedTuple` appears in the `class` statement as a superclass, it's actually not:
>```terminal
>>>> issubclass(Coordinate, NamedTuple) # it should return False, but it returns an error to me. I don't know why.
>False
>>>> issubclass(Coordinate, tuple)
>True
>```

### 3. `@dataclasses.dataclass` implementation
The class built with `@dataclasses.dataclass` method is a **subclass of `object`**:
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Coordinate:
    lat: float
    lon: float

    def __str__(self) -> str:
        ns = "N" if self.lat >= 0 else "S"
        we = "E" if self.lon >= 0 else "W"
        return f"{abs(self.lat):.1f}°{ns}, {abs(self.lon):.1f}°{we}"
    
moscow = Coordinate(55.76, 37.62)
location = Coordinate(55.76, 37.62)


print(issubclass(Coordinate, object))
print(moscow)
print(location == moscow)
```
### Main Features

**Mutable Instances**
* Both `collections.namedtuple` and `typing.NamedTuple` build `tuple` subclasses, therefore the instances are **immutable**.
* By default, `@dataclass`produces **mutable** classes. When `frozen=True`, the class will raise an exception if you try to assign a value to a field after the instance is initialized.

**Class statement syntax**
* Only `typing.NamedTuple`and `dataclass` supports regular `class` statement syntax, making it easier to add methods and docstrings.

**Construct dict**
* Both `collections.namedtuple` and `typing.NamedTuple` provide an instance method (`._asdict`) to construct a `dict` object from the fields in a data class instance.
* The `dataclasses` module provides a function to do it: `dataclasses.asdict()`.

**Get field names and default values**
* All three class builders let us define the field names and default values.
* In named tuples, that metadata is in the `._fields` and `._fields_defaults` class attributes.
* `dataclass` decorated class uses the `fields` function from the `dataclasses` module.

**Get field types**
* Class defined by `typing.NamedTuple` and `@dataclass` have an `__annotations__` attribute holding the type hints for the fields. However it's not recommended; instead, the recommended best practice is to get information with `inspect.get_annotations(MyClass)` or `typing.get_type_hints(MyClass)`.

**New instances with changes**
* Given a named tuple instance `x`, the call `x._replace(**kwargs)` returns a new instance with some attribute values replaced.
* The `dataclasses.replace(x, **kwargs)` does the same for an instance of a `dataclass` decorated class.
# Classic Named Tuples
The `collections.namedtuple` function is a factory that builds subclasses of `tuple` enhanced with fields names, a class name, and an informative `__repr__`.

Classes built with `namedtuple` can be used anywhere where tuples are needed. Each instance of a class takes the same amount of memory as a tuple.

Let's define a named tuple type:
```python
from collections import namedtuple

City = namedtuple("City", "name country population coordinates")
tokyo = City("Tokyo", "JP", 36.933, (35.689722, 139.691667))

print(tokyo)
print(tokyo.population)
print(tokyo.coordinates)
print(tokyo[1])
```
Output:
```
City(name='Tokyo', country='JP', population=36.933, coordinates=(35.689722, 139.691667))
36.933
(35.689722, 139.691667)
JP
```

In addition to some methods inherited from `tuple`, such as `__eq__`, `__lt__`, a named tuple offers a few useful attributes and methods, such as `_fields`, `_make(iterable)`, `_asdict()`.
# Typed Named Tuples
`typing.NamedTuple` is a typed version of `namedtuple` and, indeed, **type annotations** is its main feature:
```python
from typing import NamedTuple

class Coordinate(NamedTuple):
	lat: float
	lon: float
	reference: str = 'WGS84'
```
# Type Hints 101
**Type Hints**, aka **Type Annotations**, are ways to **declare the expected type of function arguments, return values, variables, and attributes**.
> [!attention] No Runtime Effect
> **Type Hints** are **not enforced at all by the Python bytecode compiler and interpeter**. Think about Type Hints as "documentation that can be verified by IDEs and type checkers (such as *Mypy*)". That's because type hints have no impact on the runtime behaviour of Python programs.

In classes (even in plain classes) variable annotations are stored into `__annotations__` attribute of that class:
```python
class DemoPlainClass:
    a: int
    b: float = 1.1
    c = 'spam'

DemoPlainClass.__annotations__
```
Output:
```
{'a': int, 'b': float}
```
# More about @dataclass
### Most common arguments
The `@dataclass` decorator accepts several keyword argument. Its signature is:
```python
@dataclass(*, init=True, repr=True, eq=True, order=False, unsafe_hash=False, frozen=False)
```
Here's a brief description of each one:
![](Books/Fluent%20Python/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240703231818.png)

The most important ones are:
* `frozen=True`: **protects against accidental changes** to the class instance. Though it could be not too hard for programmers to go around the protection afforded by this setting.
* `order=True`: allows sorting of instances of the data class.
If the `eq` and `frozen` arguments are both `True`, `@dataclass` produces a suitable `__hash__` method, so the instance will be hashable.
> [!info]- **Hashable** Objects
> According to [Python Glossary](https://docs.python.org/3.10/glossary.html), an object is **hashable** if it has a hash value which never changes during its lifetime (it needs a `__hash__()` method), and can be compared to other objects (it needs an `__eq__()` method). Hashable objects which compare equal must have the same hash value. All immutable objects are hashable, but not all hashable objects are immutable. Click on the link for more details.
### Field Options
**Mutable default values** are a common source of **bugs**. In function definitions, a mutable default value is easily corrupted when one invocation of the function mutates the default, changing the behaviour of further invocations. To prevent bugs, `@dataclass` rejects the class possibility to define default values in their definition:
```python
@dataclass
class ClubMember:
    game: str
    guests: list = []
```
This code returns the following `ValueError`:
```
[...]
ValueError: mutable default <class 'list'> for field guests is not allowed: use default_factory
```
A possible solution is to use `dataclass.field` function with `default_factory` as argument instead of using a literal (such as `[]`):
```python
from dataclasses import field

class ClubMember:
    game: str
    guests: list = field(default_factory=list)
```
The `default_factory` parameter could be any callable (such as a function, a class, etc.). When provided, it must be a zero-argument callable and it builds a default value each time an instance of the data class is created.
> [!danger] Potential bugs
> Be careful to the fact that `@dataclass` rejects class definitions only with a `list`, `dict`, and `set`. Other mutable values used as defaults will not be flagged by `@dataclass`.
