# Treat objects as objects
Standard approach in Object-Oriented Analysis and Programming: identify objects in the problem, and then model their data and behaviours. However, it isn't always as easy.

You can proceed like that:
+ store data in a few variables;
+ if you will pass the same set of related variables to a set of function, you can think about grouping both variables and functions into a **class**.

Example: start to think of a polygon as a set of points. To compute the perimeter, you need to compute the distance between each point:
```python
from __future__ import annotations
from math import hypot
from typing import Tuple, List

Point = Tuple[float, float]

def distance(p_1: Point, p_2: Point) -> float:
	return hypot(p_1[0]-p_2[0], p_1[1]-p_2[1])

square = [(1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1)]
Polygon = List[Point]

def perimeter(polygon: Polygon) -> float:
	pairs = zip(polygon, polygon[1:]+polygon[:1])
	return sum(distance(p1,p2) for p1, p2 in pairs)

perimeter(square)
```
Output:
```
4.0
```
