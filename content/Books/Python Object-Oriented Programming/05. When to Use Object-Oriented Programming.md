# Treat objects as objects
Standard approach in Object-Oriented Analysis and Programming: identify objects in the problem, and then model their data and behaviours. However, it isn't always as easy.

You can proceed like that:
+ store data in a few variables;
+ if you will pass the same set of related variables to a set of function, you can think about grouping both variables and functions into a **class**.

**Example**: start to think of a polygon as a set of points. To compute the perimeter, you need to compute the distance between each point:
```python
from __future__ import annotations
from math import hypot
from typing import Tuple, List

Point = Tuple[float, float]

def distance(p_1: Point, p_2: Point) -> float:
	return hypot(p_1[0]-p_2[0], p_1[1]-p_2[1])

square = [(1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1)]
Polygon = List[Point]

def perimeter(polygon: Polygon) -> float:
	pairs = zip(polygon, polygon[1:]+polygon[:1])
	return sum(distance(p1,p2) for p1, p2 in pairs)

perimeter(square)
```
Output:
```
4.0
```
*(I honestly didn't understand the effect of `from __future__ import annotations` in the above example)*

Looking at the code above, we notice that
* a new  `Polygon` class could encapsulate the list of points (**data**) and the `perimeter` function (**behaviour**);
* a new `Point` class could encapsulate the x and y coordinates (**data**) and the `distance` function (**behaviour**):
```python
from math import hypot
from __future__ import annotations

class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y) -> None:
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
    
    def distance(self, other: Point) -> float:
        return hypot(self.x - other.x, self.y - other.y)
    
class Polygon:
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.vertices: List[Point] = []

    def add_point(self, point: Point) -> None:
        self.vertices.append(point)

    def perimeter(self) -> float:
        pairs = zip(self.vertices, self.vertices[1:] + self.vertices[:1])
        return sum(p1.distance(p2) for p1, p2 in pairs)
    

square = Polygon()
square.add_point(Point(1,1))
square.add_point(Point(1,2))
square.add_point(Point(2,2))
square.add_point(Point(2,1))
square.perimeter()
```
Output:
```terminal
4.0
```
*(Now, it makes sense to use `from __future__ import annotations ` because in the `distance` method I'm using `Point` class that is not already defined).*

Although the latter OOP code appears longer and less compact than the former, it is much more readable and easy to understand because the relationship among the objects are more clearly defined by hints. Code length is not a goof indicator of code complexity.
# Adding behaviours to class with properties
*(I feel that topics like **setters**, **getters**, an **properties** are not clearly explained in the book, so the following chapter comes from [this link](https://realpython.com/python-property/) from realpython website, which is, as always, real amazing).*

When you want to manage class attributes, you have two ways:
* **access and mutate** the attributes directly;
* use **methods** to mutate internal data and behaviours.
