I'm Simone, an **aspiring Software Engineer**. This website is my personal space, where I'll be documenting my journey in the vast realm of software engineering. 

As of now, the content might be a bit unpredictable, but in the near future, I plan to share insights into my current studies, the courses I'm taking, and my progress in the field.

The overarching goal is to post monthly updates, reflecting on the achievements and challenges of the past month, and ensuring that I stay on track with the goals set in the previous month.

For a more in-depth understanding of who I am and my plans for this blog, I invite you to read [this post](Blog/2024-01-07.%20Presentation.md). It provides a detailed exploration of my background, aspirations, and the vision I have for this space.

Currently, I am in the process of migrating content from my old blog, which started in January 2024, to this new platform as of June 2024. This involves transferring posts, reorganizing content, and ensuring that everything is up-to-date, so some content may temporarily be missing.

I have organized the content of this Garden into various topics and sections for easier navigation and a more focused exploration. Here are the main topics:
* [Apache Spark](Apache%20Spark/index.md): Since I would like to focus my career on Data Engineering, Apache Spark is one of the primary tool of this field, so I decided to dedicate a specific section on it. The goal is to fill this section especially with Apache Spark "batch-mode" notes. If I'll have the opportunity to use the "streaming-mode" too, I'll dedicate some notes on it.
* [Blog](Blog/index.md): I post everything that isn't technical learning notes.
* [Books](Books/index.md): I post notes I am taking from books I am reading. At the time of writing, this section includes the following books:
	* [Fluent Python (by Luciano Ramalho)](Books/Fluent%20Python/index.md): This book is an intermediate-level Python book.
	* [Head First Design Pattern (by Eric Freeman & Elisabeth Robson)](Books/Head%20First%20Design%20Pattern/index.md): This book is an highly recommend book for Design Pattern. When the books need clarification or integration, I'll use videos from Christopher Okhravi's YouTube channel, which has a great playlist about design patterns: [Design Pattern Playlist by Christopher Okhravi](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrhzvIcii6GNjpARdnO4ueTUAVR9eMBpc).
	* [Python Object-Oriented Programming (by Steven F.Lott & Dusty Phillips)](Books/Python%20Object-Oriented%20Programming/index.md): This book dives into the various aspects of OOP in Python.
* [Database System](Database%20System/index.md): this is a fantastic course ([available freely on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdPALZ-GCfI&list=PLSE8ODhjZXjbj8BMuIrRcacnQh20hmY9g&index=1)) taken by Andy Pavlo from Carnegie Mellon University. It's a very long course, so along the time I'm trying to follow all the lessons and post here my notes. It's not a "practical course", in the sense that I'm not learning how to code or some specific tools, but it's giving me a great consciousness about Databases, that is a tool we constantly use all the time as software engineers. If you want to know what's happen under the hood when you use a database, I really suggest this course. Since I'm trying to get notes at best, I'm only at the 5th lesson at the time I'm writing.
* [Python](Python/index.md): I will fill this section with notes on Python topics that I find interesting or useful to know about.
* [Other](Other/index.md): this section contains scattered notes I have about Docker, Git, and other topics I study in the future.
* [Periodical Retrospective](Periodical%20Retrospective/index.md): I will regularly post recaps every 2-3 months, reflecting on my professional life, highlighting what went well, and identifying areas for improvement.
